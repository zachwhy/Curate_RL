# Reinforcement Learning applied on Cognitive Training Task

I spearheaded an intriguing project exploring the feasibility of using reinforcement-learning algorithms to personalize cognitive training tasks. We collected data from around 6000 trials with participants recruited online using a REST-api built on Heroku, Python, and MongoDB. Analyzing the strengths and limitations of various algorithms, We decided to use distributional reinforcement learning agents trained in custom environments using TF-Agent. We built and refined model parameters using over 2000 datapoints and successfully personalized the training procedures. Our work demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms in personalizing cognitive training tasks, opening up new avenues for further research in the field.
